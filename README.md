# osmflat [![travis status]][travis]

![berlin-with-some-parks-and-rivers](examples/berlin-with-some-parks-and-rivers.jpg)

Flat OpenStreetMap (OSM) data format providing an efficient *random* data access
through [memory mapped files].

The data format is described and implemented in [flatdata]. The [schema]
describes the fundamental OSM data structures: nodes, ways, relations and
tags as simple non-nested data structures. The relations between these are
expressed through indexes.

## Compiler

Besides the library for working with osmflat archives, this crate contains an
OSM [pbf format][PBF format] to osmflat data compiler.

To compile OSM data from pbf to osmflat use:

```shell
cargo run --release -- input.osm.pbf output.osm.flatdata
```

The output is a flatdata archive, which is a directory consisting of several
files. The schema is also part of the archive. It is checked every time the
archive is opened. This guarantees that the compiler which was used to produce
the archive fits to the schema used for reading it. The archive data is not
compressed.

## Using data

First, add this to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
osmflat = "0.1.0"
```

Now, you can open an osmflat archive as any other flatdata archive and read its
data:

```rust
use osmflat::{Archive, FileResourceStorage, Osm};

fn main() {
    let storage = FileResourceStorage::new("path/to/archive.osm.flatdata");
    let archive = Osm::open(storage).unwrap();

    for node in archive.nodes().iter() {
        println!("{:?}", node);
    }
}
```

Cf. the [examples] directory for more examples. Feel free to add another
example, if you have an idea what to with the amazing OSM data in few lines of
code. üòÅ

The above map was rendered by `examples/roads2png.rs` in ~ 170 loc from the osmflat
archive based on the [latest][latest-berlin-map] Berlin OSM data.
